# Amazon_Reviews_Scrapper

This project is built to ask user to search for any given product on **Amazon.in** website. Internally it will select the top product which appears on the screen. Then it will go inside the Product page and read the review comments section.

From the review comment section it will fetch each individual **Author Name**, **Star Rating** , **Comment Heading** and **Review Detail comments**  which then gets published on the screen.

**Below is the snapshot of the review section**
